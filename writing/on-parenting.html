        <h2 class="title">Why children are losing their vulnerability and curiosity</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Growing up I was best friends with my mom. I didn’t have siblings, so
        my mom and I spent most of our time together. Only recently did I learn
        that this is actually not how most people grow up and was the reason why for a while, I struggled to connect and relate with my peers, operate in
        social settings and maintain consistency in the friendships with others
        my age.</p>
      <p>“Hold on to your kids” by Gordon Nuefeld provided a significantly
        amount of clarity into why that was my experience.</p>
      <p>In the context of adult interactions, people are usually dealing with
        relationship problems. But with kids, interestingly, they’re always
        dealing with behaviour problems. Parents are often very concerned with
        their children’s identities—how they behave, learn, who they’re friends
        with, how they spend their time—and a lot less concerned about the
        parent-child relationship they cultivate.</p>
      <p>Children are born without an understanding of who they are, what is
        real, why things happen the way that they do, what is good and bad, what
        things mean, how the world works. In our first couple of years, we were
        all in a state of feeling lost and bewildered, searching for a compass.
        And when this orienteering does not come from our parents, we look for
        it in other places. Often this results in peer-orientation, where
        children use each other as their compasses, helping them move away from
        feeling lost. It does not seem to matter that their operational compass
        points are inadequate, inconsistent, and unreliable. All that matters is
        that they are no longer consciously bewildered.</p>
      <p>Kids often lack the emotional intelligence to appreciate
        vulnerability. We tend to dislike in others what we are most
        uncomfortable with in ourselves and hence, vulnerability becomes the
        enemy.</p>
      <p>When children lose their vulnerability, they surrender the idea of
        infinite possibility and fail to see the world as a welcome space for
        their self-expression. The invulnerability imprisons them to their
        limitations and anxieties, pushing children towards losing their feelings
        of fear. They no longer experience feeling alarmed or frightened,
        because nervousness requires a degree of vulnerability. Many bullies,
        and in fact, many victims, are developed in this way. With a muted alarm
        system, kids are a lot less aware of hostility and rejection that they
        should be avoiding.</p>
      <p>Young bullies will attempt to move closer to a certain group by
        moving further away from another. In this way, they don’t risk an
        rejection or pain and achieve their goal with the least amount of risk
        and vulnerability.</p>
      <p>“There is danger in loving but none in loathing, risk in admiration
        but not in contempt, vulnerability in wanting to be like someone else
        but none in mocking those who are different. Bullies instinctively take
        the least vulnerable route to their destination.”</p>
      <p>When kids lack attachment with their parents, connection with their
        peers becomes their primary concern. They will mold themselves,
        suppressing any self-expression that falls out of line with those around
        them. Friendship becomes the ultimate goal they do not let anything,
        including their individuality, fall between them and their peers.</p>
      <p>What I learned through this book is that this is a pivotal point
        which kills a child’s curiosity. Peer-attached children become obsessed
        with fitting in with their peers, killing their desire to explore things
        outside of what serves this attachment. Learning and exploring entails
        failure, which is terrifying for someone that is fleeing their
        vulnerability. So, the more we can cultivate acceptance for kids, the
        more room there will be for their unique characters to unfold.</p>
