            <p>Since infant formula was introduced in the 19th century, it has had a very on and off reputation.
                Depending on the time period, country, society and class, formula has been either encouraged, tolerated,
                or completely discouraged. But I want change this contreversy and ensure that children get the optimal
                nutrients regardless of the political opinions of the community they grow up in. by changing the way we
                approach infant formula.</p>
            <p>There are numerous <a
                    href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15274-the-benefits-of-breastfeeding-for-baby--for-mom">articles
                    and papers</a> showing that breastfed children have fewer instances of alergies, asthma, eczema as
                well as fewer cases of cancer and other diseases. Mothers breastfeeding their children is optimal for a
                child&#39;s brain and body develoment. Unfortunately, not ever woman has the time, comfort and physical
                ability to breastfeed.</p>
            <p>There are several factors associated with physical pain/discomfort that play into women’s decisions to
                stop, or to never even start breastfeeding:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sore nipples</li>
                <li>Baby not latching on properly</li>
                <li>Breast engorgement → too much breast milk</li>
                <li>Infections (for ex. Mastitis)</li>
                <li>Not enough breastmilk (23% of women)</li>
                <li>Inability to produce breastmilk (5% of women)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are also several <strong>non-health related issues</strong>, which more often than physical issues
                become the reason why women chose not to breastfeed. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Society’s standards → Women can’t just breastfeed anywhere they’d like to, so living life outside of
                    their home is quite difficult.</li>
                <li>Breastfeeding takes about 10 hours a day, its a full time job that no one other than the mother is
                    responsible for.</li>
                <li>Women having to go back to work. If working women choose to continue breastfeeding, they need to
                    pump her breasts every few hours, wear pads to soak up leakage, and keep their milk frozen. This is
                    a lot to think about on top of working a job and having an infant at home. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The result is that about 60% of women who begin breastfeeding will stop after 3–4 weeks. <strong>This
                    leaves only about 1/4 mothers who breastfeed exclusively.</strong></p>
            <h1 id="infant-formula-the-status-quo">Infant formula — The status quo</h1>
            <p>The solution for the other 75% of mothers is infant formula, which usually consists of purified cow’s
                milk, whey and casein as a protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carb
                source and a vitamin-mineral mix.</p>
            <p>In comparison, human breast milk contains live cells (stem cells), more than 1,000 different proteins,
                enzymes (that speed up chemical reactions in the body), growth factors, hormones, vitamins and minerals,
                antibodies, fatty acids and bacteria.</p>
            <p>So..</p>
            <p><strong>The problem: Breastmilk and current infant formula are clearly quite different.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The solution: Instead of replacing the components of breastmilk with completely new ingredients,
                    I’m going to replicate the components 1 for 1.</strong></p>
            <p>In this article I’m going to walk you through only one of the components, and in the future I will begin
                prototyping for more.</p>
            <h1 id="secretory-immunoglobulin-a-siga-">Secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA)</h1>
            <p>Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), are a type of protective protein produced by all animal and
                human immune systems.</p>
            <p>Antibodies work by attaching themselves to antigens, which are small parts of a bacteria, viruses,
                alergens, toxins or chemicals. After its attached, the goal of the antibody is to remove the antigen
                from the body.</p>
            <p>Different antibodies are responsible for different antigens, which also means that there are many
                different types of antibodies.</p>
            <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1356/0*xuuJCH2JD4kopOak" alt=""></p>
            <p>Antibodies are quite complicated, with lots of different components, but all you need to understand is
                the basics.</p>
            <p>There are many different antigens out there, so the antigen binding site of almost every antibody is
                different. All other parts are more or less constant across all antibodies. There are 5 different heavy
                chain types, so all antibodies are classified into either IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM. This part
                determines how the antibody fights the antigen.</p>
            <p>But other than that, there is very little differentiation. This also means that the process of
                replication of each of these antibodies is very very similar.</p>
            <p>Right now, I’m going to talk specifically about Immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is the most important
                antibody contained in breastmilk.</p>
            <h2 id="the-purpose-of-siga">The purpose of SIgA</h2>
            <p>The gut is sterile and bacteria-free at birth. Then, all of a sudden an infant is exposed to a load of
                new bacteria, viruses, microbes etc., which is where sIgA (the secretory form of IgA) comes in.</p>
            <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*l2sNsSaM2GoG5rw0RrdVWw.png" alt=""></p>
            <p>The secretory form of IgA consists of now 4 heavy chains, 4 light chains, as well as a J chain and a
                Secretory component (binding the two proteins)</p>
            <p>SIgA binds to antigens in the gut and prevents them from attaching to the inside of your stomach.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a <strong>protective coating on the inside of a person’s stomach</strong> — the
                antibodies basically creates a boundary between gut microbes and the inner lining of the stomach. These
                antibodies <strong>prevent viral infection</strong> <strong>and the spread of bacteria</strong> across
                the stomach.</p>
            <h2 id="memory-antibodies">Memory antibodies</h2>
            <p>Every time a new pathogen (any bacteria, virus or anything else that can harm the body) enters the body,
                white blood cells produce new antibodies. These antibodies then go on to fight the “invader”.</p>
            <p>But as all of this is done, the cells also make sure to write down the instructions for fighting this
                specific pathogen. This is a protective mechanism of our body to make sure that if the same organism
                ever reenters the body, it already knows how to fight it.</p>
            <h2 id="now-in-relation-to-the-mother-child">Now, in relation to the mother-child</h2>
            <p>A mother’s cells that already have the instructions for antibodies begin creating more antibodies and
                sending them to a newborn through breastmilk.</p>
            <p>This happens through the _entero-mammaric lin_k, which is a pathway connecting the gut lymphoid tissues
                (where the antibodies are made in the body) to the lactating mammary glands (glands that lead to the
                nipple).</p>
            <p>In a more practical example:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The mother already has instructions for several SIgA antibodies against the her previous gut
                    microbes</li>
                <li>This <strong>protection is transferred to the child</strong> through the <em>entero-mammaric
                        link</em>.</li>
                <li>The breastfed infant receives the antibodies, which then coat the gut and moderate the exposure of
                    the newborn’s gut to microbes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1 id="using-plants-as-bioreactors-to-manufacture-siga-antibodies">Using plants as bioreactors to
                manufacture sIgA Antibodies</h1>
            <p>When babies are fed with formula, they lack the antibodies transferred to them by their mothers.</p>
            <p>The child mortality as a cause of diarrhoea (2nd leading cause of child mortality) is <strong>25 times
                    higher</strong> in non-breastfed compared to those who were exclusively breastfed. And the leading
                cause of that is the absence of lining of a SIgA antibodies, which means that all sorts of pathogens
                enter and stay in the newborn’s gut.</p>
            <p>So if we can’t have access to the mother’s antibodies, the next best thing is to replicate them.</p>
            <p>Synthesizing monoclonal antibodies in labs and manufacturing plants has been a widespread practice for
                many years. However, manufacturing and particular, glycosalating igA is more complicated than most other
                antibodies. </p>
            <p>Yeast is the most common type of cell that is used to synthesize proteins. However, there is an advantage
                to <a
                    href="https://www.leafexpressionsystems.com/what-types-of-recombinant-proteins-can-be-expressed-in-plants/">using
                    plant cells for this type of antibody.</a></p>
            <p><strong>Size</strong> - Eukarytoic cells are better at synthesizing larger-sized proteins, like the igA.
                <strong>Glycosalation</strong> - Plants maintain their glycosylation profiles even as the bioreactor
                volume increases
                <strong>Scale-up</strong> - Scaling a plant bioreactor takes 12 months, compared to 20-22 months for CHO
                or e. coli cells.
                <strong>Cheap</strong> - plants require significantly less maintanance compared to animal cells
                <strong>Intrinsically safe</strong> — Animal and human pathogens are not involved
                <strong>Low entry barrier</strong> — Few requirements for infrastructure, skills, approvals and sterile
                conditions
            </p>
            <h2 id="tobacco-plants">Tobacco Plants</h2>
            <p>And going a little deeper, I specifically decided to use Tobacco plants as antibody factories because
                they have…</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Much greater ease of transformation, compared to other plants</li>
                <li>High biomass per unit area (means that there is high output with low input)</li>
                <li>The ability to production of large number of seeds</li>
                <li>Extremely high protein expression levels compared to other plants.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The process that I’m going to outline in the next part of this article is showing how we can basically
                engineer plants to make a 1–1 copy of any antibody that humans produce.</p>
            <h1 id="the-production-process">The production process</h1>
            <p>SIgA is the secretory form of Immunoglobulin A, which as I previously mentioned means that it has double
                the components. Most other antibodies, as well as the regular form of IgA have 2 light chains and 2
                heavy chains. 1 gene can code for 2 chains, which means that these regular antibodies need 2 genes.</p>
            <p>But, since sIgA has 4 heavy and 4 light chains, in order to be expressed in its complete form, there need
                to be <strong>4 different genes</strong>.</p>
            <h2 id="agrobacterium-tumefaciens-used-to-insert-genes-into-plant-cells">Agrobacterium Tumefaciens — used to
                insert genes into plant cells</h2>
            <p><em>Agrobacterium Tumefaciens</em> is a bacteria that can also act as a type of <strong>natural genetic
                    engineer</strong>.</p>
            <p>Just like Eukaryotic (animal) cells, bacteria have nucleases which contain chromosomes with DNA.</p>
            <p>But what makes bacteria so different is that they also have extra DNA , stored in plasmids. Plasmids are
                small circular pieces of DNA that replicate independently from the host’s chromosomal DNA, and are not
                inside of a nucleus. <em>Agrobacterium</em> has a specific type of plasmid, called a tumor inducing (TI)
                plasmid.</p>
            <p>The reason these plasmids exist is that they <strong>help bacteria much more easily transfer DNA between
                    cells</strong>, and in result also infect other cells with less effort. So in nature, these ti
                plasmids are meant to infect other cells, but we can leverage them for other purposes.</p>
            <p>Ti plasmids have an average of 200 to 800 kbp (kilobase pair, an equivilent to 1000 base pairs). A small
                portion of that (10–30 kbp) is called the T-region, which contains the <strong>T-DNA (transfer
                    DNA)</strong>. This portion of the plasmid is the storage place for the DNA (containing the gene)
                that needs to be transferred from the bacteria cell to another cell is store.</p>
            <p>Although plasmids have many other components, the two that are required for this process are the t-DNA
                and the virulence (vir) region.</p>
            <p>The virulence (vir) region is composed of <em>virA, virB, virC, virD, virE, virF,</em> <em>virG and
                    virH</em> genes, which help control and mediate the T-DNA transfer process.</p>
            <p>So… here’s the actual process of growing the antibodies!</p>
            <h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Recognition and Attachment</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Acetosyrinzon is a natural chemical compound that is released from plants when they are wounded. The virA
                protein (in the virulence region) senses this compound, which acts like a turn-on button for the rest of
                the process.</p>
            <p>When doing this <em>in vitro</em> (in a lab), wounding the plant is not ideal, so instead we simply add
                the Acetosyrinzon chemical into the media.</p>
            <p>VirA is a transmembrane (spans the entire membrane of the cell) sensor protein with the C-terminal
                portion (one end of the protein) in the cytoplasm and the N-terminal (the other end of the protein)
                portion in the periplasm. The reason for the different ends in different sections of the cells is so
                that the protein can perform more than one action.</p>
            <p>The C-terminal region, which uses its autokinase activity to Autophosphorylate (the addition of a
                phosphate to the protein). Those are big words, but the process is quite simple.</p>
            <p>Autkinase is what allows enzymes to attach phosphate groups to molecules. Autophosphorylation is the
                actual process of the addition of phosphate groups to molecules.</p>
            <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*fP8JDajRFf7EP57t.png" alt=""></p>
            <p>A visual of phosphorylation</p>
            <p>As soon as it is phosphorylated, this acts like an on switch for the protein. This part is the
                responsibility of the other end of VirA, the N-terminal region. The phosphate is transferred from the C
                to the N-terminal, which then switches “on” the protein.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Activation of the <em>vir</em> genes</strong></p>
            <p>The VirG protein is responsible for <strong>activating the rest of the virulence proteins</strong>. The
                protein binds to a DNA sequence that is present in the promotor region (on and off switch of a gene) of
                all <em>vir</em> genes.</p>
            <p>Notice how I keep using the on and off switch, since this is all a big chain reaction.</p>
            <p>Once the protein is bound to the DNA sequence, the rest of the <em>vir</em> genes are activated.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Recognition of T-DNA</strong></p>
            <p>The activated VirD1/VirD2 proteins recognize the 25bp borders around the T-DNA. They then make a small
                cut to the bottom strand of the T-DNA at the borders (using endonuclease activity, which is the process
                of enzymes cutting DNA).</p>
            <p>Whenever DNA is transferred, always only either the top or the bottom strand is used. The strand used
                then acts as a template for the creation of the other strand. Doing this is simply much easier than
                transferring both strands of DNA.</p>
            <p>So, the DNA in between the two cuts is now the DNA that will be transferred to the other cell.</p>
            <p>The VirD2 protein remains covalently bound (chemical bond where atoms share electrons) to the 5&#39; end
                of the single stranded T-DNA. One reason for this is to prevent exonucleotic attacks, where exonucleases
                attack the ends of nucleic acid molecules and try remove pieces of the single stranded DNA. The 5&#39;
                end is now the leading end for the T-DNA transfer.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer into the plant cell</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So now comes the actual transportation part, the complex is in a UPS delivery truck🚛. The virD2 protein
                is the driver of the truck, the ssT-DNA are the packages that need to be delivered, and the virE2
                protein (this ones new) is the metal that makes up the truck.</p>
            <p>The VirE2 protein is a single strand DNA binding protein that coats and protects the single stranded
                T-DNA-VirD2 complex. The VirE2 protein also elongates the DNA strand to reduce the diameter to about
                2nm. Because of the way DNA is built, if you stretch it out, it reduces in width, which makes it easier
                for the complex to fit through the membrane channels (the tunnel from cell to cell).</p>
            <p><strong>5. Creation of the membrane-spanning protein channel</strong></p>
            <p>This is where the VirB proteins come in and assemble the channel between the two cells.</p>
            <p>The VirB7 and VirB9 proteins travel to the membrane and form covalently cross-linked protein structures
                called heterodimmers with one another. This protein structure is then transported to the outer membrane,
                where it assembles into the membrane channel.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Integration into the plant genome</strong></p>
            <p>The VirE2 protein contains two plant signals and VirD2 contains one, which means that once the T-DNA
                structure enters the plant cell, the nucleus can sense that the complex is there.</p>
            <p>The 3&#39; end of the T’DNA senses homologies (similarities) with plant DNA, which creates the first
                contact called synapses.</p>
            <p>Restriction enzymes then make cuts in the plant DNA and inserts the single stranded DNA into the bottom
                strand. Since Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine, the bottom strand is used as
                a template for the upper strand.</p>

            <p>Cool visual diagram of the process, if this helps you understand:)</p>
            <p>Then comes the construction of the protein, which is now completely the job of the plant. The first step
                is that ribosomes help create a long chain of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). The order
                of these amino acids is determined by mRNA.</p>
            <p>The growth of the protein takes only about a week, which then leads us into the final steps of the
                process.</p>
            <h1 id="extraction-and-purification">Extraction and Purification</h1>
            <p>SIgA consists of 4 monomeric structures, a complex of 2 heavy and 2 light chains, joined by a J chain and
                a secretory component. I talked about this earlier, but this is very important!!</p>
            <p>And since this process can only support 1 gene at a time, a series of sexual crosses (cross-pollination)
                have to be performed between plants in order to generate plants that simultaneously have all four
                protein chains expressed.</p>
            <p>So, there are now 4 different versions of plants, each expressing independently either the light chain,
                heavy chain, J chain, or the secretory component. These 4 versions of plants are <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVWsDUWRgT4">cross-bread</a>, which results in a new plant
                that expresses all 4 genes and is ready for extraction + purification.</p>
            <h2 id="downstream-processing">Downstream Processing</h2>
            <p>Everything I’ve talked about now is called the upstream processing — when the biomolecules are actually
                grown. However, the most complex + expensive (representing more than 3/4 of the total production cost)
                part is the downstream processing — recovery and the purification of biosynthetic products.</p>
            <p>There are different ways we can extract proteins from plants, but I’ll walk you through only one of them
                right now.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twZe627pbp8"><strong>Tissue Disinegration</strong></a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first step is basically <strong>breaking down the plant tissue and disrupting the cell
                    walls</strong>, in order to maximize the amount of protein that is released during extraction. So
                now we’re just breaking apart the plant, as much as possible using hammer mills for wet and dry
                grinding, high-shear rotor-stator mixers, and high-pressure homogenizers. Basically blenders on 10x
                mode.</p>
            <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1164/0*hg-1H-TzSsq4xcFa.png" alt=""></p>
            <p>This is a hammer mill🔨</p>
            <p><strong>2. Solid-liquid separation</strong></p>
            <p>This part can get complicated, but I’m going to simple it down to a <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYaPLIX4VM">1 minute video</a>.</p>
            <p>Tl;dr of what happens: A centrifugation process is used to separate particles based on density. This
                takes out all of the solid material and leaves us only with leaf juice.🧃</p>
            <p><strong>3. Using the Aqueous two-phase extraction method to clarify and pretreat the extracts</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The previously performed tissue + cell disinegration also releases several other water-soluble cell
                components, such as DNA, chlorophyll, pigments, alkaloids, phenolics, soluble cell wall polysaccharides
                and proteases. These all have to removed to make sure that the purification yields are as high as
                possible.</p>
            <p>If you’re interested, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd75p9cXmqQ&amp;feature=emb_title">here’s
                    another 1 minute video</a> that shows the process.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Using Protein A to capture and purify the antibodies</strong></p>
            <p>The antibodies in a solution of all sorts of other components is placed into protein A resin. The
                solution passes through a column, where the protein binds to the antibodies and the rest of the
                components just pass through the column.</p>
            <p>The antibody is then separated from the ligand (protein a) by lowering the pH levels, which changes the
                buffer conditions allowing the antibody to set free from the protein.</p>
            <p>In theory and in practice, this process works perfectly, but the price of protein A purification is still
                extremely high.</p>
            <p><strong>So as of right now, my goal is to figure out the best and cheapest ways to purify these
                    proteins.</strong></p>
            <p>Tl;dr</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are many components in breastmilk that are not present in current baby formula. Since only 25%
                    of women exclusively breastfeed, this creates significant problems for the 75% of children who are
                    given formula or regular food.</li>
                <li>SIgA is the most important antibody contained in breastmilk, and the process of replication is
                    fairly simple</li>
                <li>Because plants can produce proteins, I turned to plants to produce these antibodies. Using animals
                    is not very safe, cheap, scalable or renewable.</li>
                <li>I’m using a type of bacteria called Agrobacterium Tumefaciens, which is a natural genetic engineer.
                    This is used to insert antibody producing genes into a plant, which will then kickstart the plant’s
                    protein production process.</li>
                <li>A current setback is the price of purification of antibodies, which is more than 3/4 of the price it
                    takes to do this. That’s what I’ll be working on for next little bit, and will soon write about it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The female body is so well adapted to carrying a child, giving birth, breastfeeding etc., but there are
                still so many problems associated with the entire process.</p>
            <p>There are still mothers dying post-partum, miscarriages happen all the time, breastfeeding can be an
                extremely draining process, women regularly cannot get pregnant etc.</p>
            <p>Replicating breastmilk to combat the problems every mothers experiences with breastfeeding is a step
                closer to helping women all around the world live a more comfortable life. And I’m so excited for it.
