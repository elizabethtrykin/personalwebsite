            <h2 id="trees">Trees</h2>
            
            <p>When you meander through a 10K, you see the trees over three hours. When you sprint it, those same trees blur past in 45 minutes. Over the last few years, I've struggled to understand why my life feels so saturated - each three-month period since 2021 feels as dense as others' three years.</p>

            <p>People often do a double-take when they learn my age after even shallow interactions. Their bewilderment makes sense when you understand how I move through life. Most float with the current, waiting for life to happen to them, choosing paths that are safe, predictable, unambiguous. Maybe that's the wiser choice.</p>

            <p>But I sprint the 10K. I sprint because of an insatiable hunger to experience life's fullness, because of burning ambition, because of unconventional views on how life should be lived, because of a relentless appetite for more. There isn't time to meander – unironically, AGI will redefine so much of what we know, before I'd finish my leisurely walk and extract life's lessons.</p>

            <p>The trees I sprint past come in many forms. Some bear the fruit of betrayal, disappointment, and searing pain. Others bloom with radical love, inspiration, and hope. I've used this tree metaphor since childhood because trees represent something rare: permanence, unwavering stability, unconditional love, and selfless support. They're one of nature's few creations whose entire purpose is to benefit others, asking nothing in return.</p>

            <p>Beyond pretty poeticism – trees will literally give you oxygen regardless of how you treat them. Strip them bare, tear off their branches, set them aflame through carelessness, and still they support your existence until their last breath. Even in death, their decomposing forms enrich the soil beneath them, birthing new life to support you.</p>

            <p>Perhaps these intense experiences – these trees I sprint past – exist purely to nurture growth, to saturate life with meaning, to push me toward experiencing existence's full spectrum. As you might guess, I recently collided with a tree of betrayal and disappointment. Of course it hurts to be reminded that running is painful.</p>

            <p>But if I could rewind one kilometer, would I choose differently? I would not. This is the price of admission for a saturated, deep and full life. For gaining wisdom, resilience, and mental fortitude. Let the sprint go on.</p>
