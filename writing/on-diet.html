        <h2 class="title">Why I don't eat chicken and tofu</h2>
      </header>
      <p>A couple years ago, I got really into rock-climbing. Summer of 22, my
        climbing mentor and I would go outdoor climbing every week. He was
        diagnosed with a terminal disease and had committed himself to climbing,
        pushing himself to his limits because he had nothing to lose. And I
        pushed myself to my limits because it felt extraordinarily freeing. We
        were a really good team.</p>
      <p>On one very hot day, we were climbing, when my body suddenly started
        shutting down. I spent the next few hours on a rock a little far away
        from my friends, passing in and out of consciousness and battling the
        worst nausea of my life. Anything I ate or drank, my body would
        immediately throw up. By the evening I was so dehydrated I couldn’t
        walk, had to be carried out of the forest and brought to a hospital. My
        nausea didn’t stop for another 8 hours, after which I was fed and
        hydrated via IV and could only have my first normal meal three days
        later. This was just the beginning of my health adventures.</p>
      <p>Over the next 6 months, these episodes would continue happening,
        while all of my medical imaging showed up as completely normal. It felt
        like anything I did triggered my chronic acid reflux. Medically, there
        was nothing wrong with me, so I started studying my body, trying to
        figure out how to reduce these symptoms.</p>
      <p>I cut out anything that could induce physical or psychological stress
        out of my life—strenuous physical activity, most food, harmful
        relationships etc. The one physical stressor I kept in my life was
        climbing—I took example from my mentor and continued climbing. I think
        climbing was the thing that saved me through a period of ambiguity and
        fear. My climbing mentor is still alive today, largely attributed to his
        dedication to a specific mission throughout his disease. Maybe I’ll
        write about that separately.</p>
      <h2 id="why-my-stomach-was-chronically-inflamed.">Why my stomach was
        chronically inflamed.</h2>
      <p>The stomach is highly acidic, with a pH between 1.5 and 3.5, while
        the esophagus is closer to neutral, with a pH between 6 and 8. A muscle
        called the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) separates the two organs,
        preventing acidic content from entering the esophagus. Acid reflux
        happens when the LES relaxes as a result of incorrect diet/routine and
        stomach acid enters the esophagus, damaging the lining, causing
        inflammation and pain.</p>
      <p>So, some immediate changes I made was to cut out foods that directly
        relax the LES muscle, including caffeine, alcohol, highly-processed
        foods, fatty foods and tomatoes. This helped control my condition.</p>
      <p>I originally made these lifestyle changes to stop my body from
        throwing fits. However, I saw such a huge change in my quality of life
        and ended up implementing more strategies that would reduce inflammation
        and improve my baseline.</p>
      <p>I’m writing this to share my experience and understanding of my diet,
        in hopes that it can help you. Your symptoms of inflammation may be
        extremely mild—maybe your baseline is a little more lethargic or you
        have slightly more brain-fog—so you don’t really notice or pay attention
        to these things. Unfortunately for me, it took over my life, so I had to
        figure it out.</p>
      <p>You’ve likely heard about all the foods and products that cause
        inflammation and thought about how its too unrealistic to cut it all
        out. Inflammation is your body’s healing response to harmful toxins that
        enter the body. It’s not inherently bad, but unfortunately, so much of
        what most of us eat on a daily basis causes inflammation. The result is
        that we are all chronically inflamed. I believe that the 80/20 principal
        applies here, and wanted to bring your attention to the changes that
        impacted me and my friends the most.</p>
      <h2 id="what-does-organic-actually-mean">What does organic actually
        mean?</h2>
      <p>Most people, including myself a few years ago, don’t know.</p>
      <p>Most farming in the world is monocultured, which requires absurd
        amounts of pesticides to maintain. Organic produce is farmed without
        synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides or other artificial
        additives. Organic farming relies on natural fertilizers like manure and
        uses biological pest control methods.</p>
      <p>I won’t to go into how pesticides are toxic, since there is a lot of
        already-existing content and research which covers that. <a
          href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9231402/">Here’s</a>
        one paper you can look at. What is important is that they’re a huge
        driver of inflammation.</p>
      <p>Organic meat guarantees that the poultry or cattle is raised without
        antibiotics, growth hormones or other synthetic drugs. The animals are
        also fed with 100% organic feed, removing the presence of pesticides,
        fertilizers and other additives from their diet. ## Stevia, soy, chicken
        and commercial red-meat are disrupting your hormones.</p>
      <p><strong>Stevia</strong></p>
      <p>Stevia, a huge part of the modern-day “healthy diet”, is made of
        steviol, which can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26965840/">significantly
          increase</a> progesterone production in cells. Steviol at a
        concentration of 25,000 ng/ml decreases the transcriptional activity of
        the progestogen receptor and can increase progesterone production by 5
        fold.</p>
      <p>Based on a weight of 60 kg (132 pounds), the acceptable daily intake
        (ADI) of Steviol is 240 mg per day. For a total blood volume of 5L, you
        would need to consume 125mg of Steviol to achieve a Steviol
        concentration of 25,000 ng/ml in your blood. Theoretically, you only
        need half of the ADI of Steviol to increase progesterone production 5x.
        It should be taken into account that this study was done in in-vitro
        conditions and may have different results in-vivo.</p>
      <p>If you look at the food label of the food you consume, a lot of it
        will unfortunately contain Stevia.</p>
      <p><strong>Soy</strong></p>
      <p>Soy-products have been marketed incredibly well with the rise of
        veganism/vegetarianism. Vegan products have significantly higher margins
        than meat, which is why they are so heavily pushed on society. The US
        has so much soy that it is basically free. Unfortunately, soybeans are
        really high in phytoestrogens, which bind to estrogen receptors in the
        body and can disrupt the natural hormone function within the body.</p>
      <p><strong>Chicken</strong></p>
      <p>Chicken feed consists of soy beans as the main source of protein. <a
          href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28625952/">This</a> study shows
        how commercial chicken feed and commercial chicken meat directly change
        a rats hormone levels.</p>
      <p>Beyond its hormonal influence, chickens’ mono-gastric stomachs cannot
        convert the linoleic acid in soy into less harmful fats. A chicken’s fat
        profile is extremely high in omega-6, about 3 times as high as in
        grass-fed beef. Omega-6 fatty acids are high in arachidonic acid, which
        are also precursor to inflammatory eiconasoids.</p>
      <p><strong>Red-meat</strong></p>
      <p>When I tell people I eat primarily red meat, the reaction I
        frequently receive is, “isn’t beef in the US worse than chicken?” Yes,
        cattle in the US is mostly farmed worse than poultry because farms are
        allowed to pump cows with hormones. The FDA allows for hormones (such as
        estradiol, testosterone, progesterone and zeranol) to be used in cattle
        to promote growth and improve feed efficiency. Feed additives, including
        growth promoters, ionophores and other supplements are also used to
        enhance their growth. In the US, some cattle is even treated with bovine
        growth hormone (rBGH) and bovine somatrotropin (rBST) to increase milk
        production. This is banned in 30 other countries.</p>
      <p>Grass-fed, or even better, grass-finished hormone-free beef is
        significantly better than any chicken you will likely find in the US. I
        have nothing against pasture-raised chickens on small farms (which are
        not fed with soy), they’re just unfortunately really difficult to farm
        and find.</p>
      <h2 id="eating-at-night-disrupts-your-circadian-rhythm-and-drives-your-inflammation.">Eating
        at night disrupts your circadian rhythm and drives your
        inflammation.</h2>
      <p>The circadian system is composed of two parts: the central clock in
        the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and peripheral clocks in
        various tissues throughout the body. This built-in feedback loop,
        regulated by transcription and translation of genetic material, turns
        clock genes on and off throughout the 24-hour day. A disruption of the
        body’s rhythm can change the timing of clock genes, causing downstream
        effects that can lead to glucose intolerance, insulin sensitivity, and
        ectopic fat accumulation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mnfr.201900867?saml_referrer">This</a>study
        shows the change in rats’ biomarkers depending on the time of day that
        they are fed. Rats that were fed late at night showed a phase delay of 4
        hours in the expression of key clock genes, causing chronic inflammation
        in their bodies, as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Significant weight gain and increased overall liver weight.</li>
        <li>The mRNA expression of lipogenic regulators (lipogenesis is the
          formation of fat) became significantly more unregulated. There was a
          large increase in the quantity of inflammatory immune cells and lipids
          in the liver and a decrease in the expression of enzymes that rate-limit
          fatty acids.</li>
        <li>Significant increase in expression of fatty acid transport genes and
          pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and
          interleukin 1β), mucus, and antimicrobial peptide secretion-related
          genes in both the ileum and jejunum samples, causing intestinal
          inflammation. Similar results were found in the muscles and colon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This research is consistent across human studies (<a
          href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2881">source</a>). ## I got
        over eating sugar by being grossed out by what it does to me. There are
        dozens of ways in which sugar affects your body. The following is one
        major example of how sugar affects the normal function of our cells, and
        is specific enough that I think about this every time I have sugar.</p>
      <p>Your body oxidizes sugar to process it and too much oxidation
        increases the body’s production of free radicals. This puts cells under
        oxidative stress and triggers inflammation pathways.</p>
      <p>Sugars react with proteins and lipids to form advanced glucation end
        products (AGEs). Added sugars provides more substrates/reactants for AGE
        transformation. Chemical additives and preservatives provide reactive
        carbonyl groups or promote oxidative reactions that can also help
        facilitate the reaction. AGEs bind to receptors that activate
        intercellular signalling pathways, causing stress for your cells and
        overall body. For example, AGEs: - Cross-link proteins, altering their
        normal function and impairing cellular antioxidant defenses. -
        Accumulate in the mitochondria, activate NADPH Oxidase and in
        combination with transition metals, result in redox cycling. These all
        cause in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
        The ROS generated can damage cellular components like DNA, proteins, and
        lipids, - Modify and inactivate antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide
        dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, reducing the cell’s ability
        to detoxify radical oxygen species. - Translocates NF-κB to the nucleus,
        promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
      <p><strong>Seed oils and your cooking method may be contributing to the
          problem.</strong></p>
      <p>Seed oils are polyunsaturated fats that oxidate when exposed to heat
        and produce free radicals. High-temperature cooking also accelerates the
        reaction that forms AGEs. Some low-AGE cooking methods include boiling
        and steaming, slow cooking at a lower temperature, baking or roasting.
        ## “Natural Flavour” is extremely deceiving <a
          href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-501#p-501.22(a)(3)">The
          US government defines</a> “natural flavor” as flavours derived from
        plant or animal sources. However, non-organic foods allow for dozens of
        different preservatives and solvents to be added to these natural
        flavours. While food processors are mandated to list all of their
        components on their food labels, flavour manufacturers are not. This
        means that as long as the “natural flavour” contains some protein from
        some plant, they can add whatever other approved chemical they
        desire.</p>
      <p>In summary, the following are the most important dietary changes I
        made. - Eating only grass-fed, hormone-free red meat (preferably game
        meat, such as elk, moose, bison, boar) and wild-caught seafood. -
        Organic produce. - Decreased processed foods, especially those with
        long/unfamiliar ingredient lists, seed oils, “natural flavours”, stevia,
        soy and sugars. - Became extremely mindful of when I eat sugar. -
        Stopped eating past 5pm. - Instead of frying, I started boiling,
        steaming, slow cooking at a lower temperature, baking and roasting.</p>
      <p>Every person in my life that has tried this for 1 week says it
        completely changes their energy levels, brain-fog, overall mood, feeling
        of strength and healthiness. Hopefully this inspires you to try
        something similar.</p>
