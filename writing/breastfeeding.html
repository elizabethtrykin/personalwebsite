            <h1>Breastfeeding is the single best way to prevent child-mortality.</h1>
            <p>If 95% of children were to be breastfed, we could prevent 823,000 child deaths (half of total anual child
                deaths) and 20,000 breast cancer deaths anually.</p>
            <p>No other single solution has the power to reduce child mortality to such a significant extent.</p>
            <p>But, currently only about 30% of women exclusively breastfeed for the first 12 months of their child‚Äôs
                life.</p>
            <p>If that isn‚Äôt crazy enough, there were also more women breastfeeding in the 1960s than there are in 2021.
                That means that if the same number of children were breastfed as there were in the 60s, we could save
                about 200,000 children every year.</p>
            <p>Social development at its finestüòÉ.</p>
            <p>There are several reasons as to why all those statements work the way they do, and I‚Äôm going to walk you
                through all of it in my writing.</p>
            <p><strong>Lets start with why the number of women breastfeeding has decreased.</strong></p>
            <p>Up until the recent 10,000 years, there were really only two primary options for mothers in the
                breastfeeding situation. It was either they fed their own baby, or they‚Äôd get a wet-nurse to do it
                instead (another mother that would feed + take care of the babies). A wet-nurse was usually part of the
                lower class, and it was considered that this practice had no harm to the baby, since they thought that
                all breastmilk was universally the same. <strong>Unfortunately, that is not how it worksü•≤.</strong></p>
            <p>Then, the agricultural revolution happened and humans domesticated animals, so we started to use animal
                milk as an alternative to breastmilk for infants.</p>
            <p>However, animal milk does not have the right composition, with too much sodium + casein. So, that also
                didn‚Äôt really work, since the child mortality almost doubled.</p>
            <p>We learned, and now less children are fed with pure animal milküêÑ.</p>
            <p>Then, in the 1970s, all of a sudden everyone went insane for formula once it was introduced. The product
                was presented in such a way that convinced people that formula has the same qualities, or in some cases
                has even better nutrients than breastmilk. <strong>Unfortunately, this is also not true.</strong></p>
            <p>People started realizing this, so now more and more women are beginning to breastfeed, compared to the
                1970s and 1980s. But we still haven‚Äôt reached the breastfeeding percentage that stood before formula was
                introduced. Which is understandable, again, there are many many reasons women do not breastfeed.</p>
            <h2>How Lactation works</h2>
            <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>Although the breast experiences significant change prior to pregnancy, when women undergo a pregnancy and
                lactation cycle (PLC), the breast is completely remodelled.</p>
            <p>This process is controlled by increased levels of the lactogenic complex of reproductive hormones:
                estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, as well as metabolic hormones (growth hormone, glucocorticoids,
                parathyroid hormone- related protein, and insulin).</p>
            <h3>Mammary Glands</h3>
            <p><img alt="Super basic diagram of the anatomy of a mammary gland"
                    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*YfAlSL6OTAd5wMszhMmnow.jpeg" /><em>Super basic
                    diagram of the anatomy of a mammary gland</em></p>
            <p>Mammary glands (medical term for the breast) are modified sweat glands (sweat glands are a type of
                organ). They primarily consist of lactiferous ducts (help transfer milk), which expand and branch out
                during pregnancy. Clusters of breast alveoli form from these ducts and expand toward the chest wall
                (ribs), since that is the contact point with the rest of the body.</p>
            <p>Alveoli look like small balloons, that are lined with lactocytes, which are the cells that produce most
                of the breastmilk. Milk is secreted by the lactocytes, filled into the alveoli, the squeezed through the
                ducts into the milk ducts and into the nipple.</p>
            <p><img alt="The anatomy of the breast before vs towards the end of pregnancy. This is to show you the severe change that the breast undergoes."
                    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2920/1*osvh2m3i1Yc805I3hZFYfw.png" /><em>The anatomy of the
                    breast before vs towards the end of pregnancy. This is to show you the severe change that the breast
                    undergoes.</em></p>
            <p>These changes happen in 2 major steps:</p>
            <h3>Secretory differentiation (previously called lactogenisis I)</h3>
            <p>During this stage, the hormones in a woman‚Äôs body induce the stem cells in the breast to <a
                    href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/regulation-of-gene-expression-and-cell-specialization/v/cellular-specialization-differentiation">differentiate</a>
                into lactocytes, which then have the capacity to synthesize (generate) breast milk.</p>
            <p>Up until delivery, a hormone called progesterone interferes with the prolactin hormone, which prevents
                the mammary glands from fully lactating. So in order for the mother to have the ability to breastfeed, a
                second step of hormonal processes need to occur.</p>
            <p>However, during this stage the glands still have the capacity to produce small amounts of a pre-milk
                substance called colostrum. This substance lasts about 6 weeks after the child‚Äôs birth, and is the most
                concentrated in antibodies + nutrients. When a child is born, they are exposed to so many new pathogens
                (although there are currently studied being done that suggest the fetus is exposed to bacteria in the
                placenta). Colostrum is the first substance that is fed to the child, which is why it is the most
                concentrated in immunogenic components.</p>
            <h3>Secretory Activation</h3>
            <p>When the child is born, progesterone hormone levels significantly decrease, which signals the mammary
                glands to start producing real breastmilk.</p>
            <h2>Components of breastmilk</h2>
            <p>Human milk contains over 2,500 different components, the concentration of which can change every hour.
                This makes human milk one of the most complex fluids on earth.</p>
            <p>Previous research shows that the primary component is water (87%), and most of the other components are
                categorized into either lactose (7%), fats (4%) and proteins (1.0%). However, we are now understanding
                the breastmilk also contains complete cells, although it is underdetermined at what amounts.</p>
            <p>All of the molecular components of breast milk are either synthesized by lactocytes (the
                breastmilk-producing cells I previously talked about in the breast) or imported into milk from the
                breast‚Äôs blood supply. <strong>However, breastfeeding is extremely understudied, which means that there
                    has very little research done on how some of the nutrients actually get to the breastmilk.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>I will mostly be writing about the immunogenic components of breastmilk, since the absence of those is
                the biggest factor to child mortality. It is important to consider that although it is not the focus of
                this article, casein, fats, minerals and vitamins are extremely important for the development of the
                child (especially the prefrontal cortex).</p>
            <h3>Immunogenic components</h3>
            <p>The transplacental (between mother and child) transfer of immugenic functions is extremely important for
                a newborn. There are three primary ways immunity is transferred:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Transfer of antibodies through the placenta</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Anti-infective resistance factors in the amniotic fluid (a fluid excreted by the infant that
                        fills up the amniotic sac which coats the child in the womb).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Through colostrum and milk (what I‚Äôm narrowing into in the rest of this article)</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The primary chemical barrier that protects the intestine is contained in the mucus layers lining the
                Gastrointestinal tract. These mucus layers minimize contact between pathogens that enter the bacteria
                and the epithelial cells inside the stomach.</p>
            <p>There are multiple different types of immunogenic factors in breastmilk including: immunoglobulins
                (antibodies), lactoferrin, lysozymes and cytokines. New research also shows that breast milk contains
                epithelial cells, stem cells, and is a continuous source of beneficial (probiotic) bacteria, including
                Lactobacillis and Bifidobacterium.</p>
            <p>All of these factors add another layer of complex protection to the intestinal mucus layers.</p>
            <p>Let‚Äôs start with antibodies.</p>
            <h3>Immunoglobulins (antibodies)</h3>
            <p>Immunoglobulins, are the primary proteins protecting a human from infection.</p>
            <p>The primary immunoglobulin in breastmilk Secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), which makes up about 90% of
                all antibodies in breastmilk. SIgA lines the inside of the stomach and blocks pathogen contact with the
                intestinal epithelial layer by binding to and trapping them. SIgA ends up sitting in the stomach
                throughout the life of a human, protected from proteolysis by sugar components (galactose, fucose, and
                mannose) caused by the acids (the breakdown of proteins).</p>
            <p>Immunoglobulins are transferred to the mammary glands through the <strong>entero-mammary link.
                </strong>This is a blood pathway linking the mother‚Äôs gut and the alveoli of the breast. This is
                extremely understudied, however, research hypothesize that when the woman‚Äôs hormone levels change, this
                signals different components to be sent to the breast.</p>
            <p>How and why these hormones change is what we have yet to understand.</p>
            <h2>Cells in breastmilk</h2>
            <p>Researchers first discovered the presence of cells in breastmilk about a decade ago, when they found
                modified milk stem cells within the brain, thymus, pancreas, liver, spleen, and kidneys of an infant.
            </p>
            <p>Every month, new research is coming out about the cells contained in breast milk. Here is a diagram of
                the most up-to-date knowledge of these cells:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2612/1*v5EwHvvqQtYR25iEmuOV_w.png" /></p>
            <p>The cells originating in the breast include lactocytes (secretory cells), myoepithelial cells, progenitor
                cells and mammary stem cells, and a small number of amount epithelial cells from the nipple and skin of
                the breast. Cells originating from the blood include immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and
                lymphocytes) and hematopoietic stem cells.</p>
            <h3>Leukocytes ‚Äî white blood cells</h3>
            <p>Animal studies have proved that white blood cells fount in breast milk survive through the infant‚Äôs
                digestive tract, and then translocate into the blood, lymph nodes, spleen and liver.</p>
            <p>In the diagram, everything under ‚Äúimmunological cells‚Äù is a type of white blood cell.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWSWWPZYGHU">White blood cells</a> are extremely essential to
                our bodies, by fighting pathogens directly via phagocytosis (killing pathogens), producing bioactive
                components (such as antibodies) modifying the microenvironment of the infant digestive tract.</p>
            <p>However, they only constitute &lt; 2% of cells that travel to the breast through the blood stream. So,
                that leaves the question about what all the other cells are.</p>
            <h3>Stem cells</h3>
            <p>A few studies suggested that human milk contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are found in bone
                marrow and are important for making and repairing skeletal tissues, such as cartilage, bone and the fat
                found in bone marrow.</p>
            <p>Researchers have also discovered that breast milk contains pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability
                to replicate into more stem cells, as well as differentiate into any cell in the body. For example, we
                have been able to differentiate pluripotent cells in vitro into adipose cells, chondrocytes,
                osteoblasts, neuronal cells, hepatocyte-like cells and pancreatic beta cells, as well as lactocytes and
                myoepithelial cells.</p>
            <p>That‚Äôs a lot of words for these stem cells can literally turn into any cell in the body, and breastmilk
                provides a supple of them to the infant.</p>
            <h3>Macrophages</h3>
            <p>About 80% of the cells in early milk are breast milk <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNrD8uPPf4w&amp;t=3s">macrophages</a>, which originate as
                peripheral blood monocytes, which look something like the image below.</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2910/1*J2iqK_1uJc2vxHr2m7Z07w.jpeg" /></p>
            <p>These cells are constantly circuling the blood stream, and with the right hormone levels, will exit the
                bloodstream and migrate into milk through the mammary epithelium (cells that line the surface of the
                milk ducts in the breast).</p>
            <p>The presence of GM-CSF, which is a cytokine (signalling protein) causes these monocytes to differentiate
                into potent breast milk macrophages. The macrophages then have the ability to differentiate into
                dendritic cells that stimulate infant T-cell (immunological) activity.</p>
            <h2>Oligosaccharides</h2>
            <p>Glycoproteins are proteins that have oligosaccharide attached to them.</p>
            <p><img alt="This is a protein, and the different shapes are different oligosaccharide attached to it."
                    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*PgSSHVvKp1T3DWIlHJq40A.png" /><em>This is a protein,
                    and the different shapes are different oligosaccharide attached to it.</em></p>
            <p>Human milk glycoproteins (HMGPs) MUC1 and MUC4 bind to HIV, rotavirus, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and
                <em>Salmonella </em>pathogens. There are ther HMGPs that bind to <em>H. influenzae</em>, Streptococci,
                <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, Reovirus, <em>E. coli</em>, and <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>.</p>
            <p>The interactions between glycoprotein and ligands are being modeled using nanosurface plasmon resonance
                and glycan microarrays.</p>
            <h3>Lactoferrin</h3>
            <p>SIgA (the antibody I previously talked about) and lactoferrin correspond to 26% of the protein content of
                breast milk. So, these two components are extremely important, and therefore, are the ones I am
                studying.</p>
            <p>What lactoferrin does is it regulates how well the iron is absorbed by the immune system. In particular,
                lactoferrin binds the iron in breast milk, which limits its availability to pathogens. In this way, it
                also starves the bacteria of nutrients, and just in case that wasn‚Äôt enough, will sometimes destroy the
                walls around bacteria.</p>
            <p>Lactoferrin has many other abilities, for example it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Has a direct cytotoxic effect against bacteria, viruses, and fungi</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Blocks inflammatory cytokines (signal-sending proteins) such as IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, TNF-Œ± and IL-824‚Äì26.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Interferes with viral attachment as well as the contact with the specific entry receptors, such
                        as ACE2. <strong>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2</strong> (<strong>ACE2</strong>) is an enzyme
                        that attaches to the membranes of cells located in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and
                        intestines. This creates an interference, and can sometimes result in lowered blood pressure.
                        Therefore, targeting ACE2 is a cool option for treating + preventing cardiovascular diseases.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are several other glycoproteins, another one being Lactadherin, which. can inactivate viruses and
                limit inflammation by increasing the effective phagocytosis (killing) of apoptotic (useless but not yet
                dead) cells.</p>
            <p>The list of bioactive glycoproteins in human milk is constantly expanding and their individual functions
                are being studied.</p>
            <h2>The gut microbiome</h2>
            <p>The gut microbiome is consistently being linked to literally every disease you could possibly imagine.
                Having a greater diversity of bacteria in the gut is directly linked to better mental and physical
                health.</p>
            <p>For example, chronic cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the US, with heart
                disease and diabetes costing &gt;$500 billion a year, and affecting around 60% of individuals over their
                lifetime. Pathogenesis (development of a disease) develops over decades, with many different
                contributing factors, such as environmental exposures, diet, and genetic background.</p>
            <p>However, researchers have found that people with a more diverse microbiome are less likely to develop a
                cardiovascular disease. The diversity of the gut microbiota is primarily expanded in the first years of
                our lives, and dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) in infancy may affect long-term health of the gut
                microbiota.</p>
            <p>Breastmilk is the main contributor to a well-developed and diverse microbiome, due to a an active
                presence of bacteria. It is estimated that an infant feeding on 800 ml of breast milk per day could
                ingest 107‚Äì108 bacterial cells daily!</p>
            <p>To date, metagenomic analysis of human milk shows that it contains &gt;360 different prokaryotic cells.
                The most frequent bacteria found in human milk are categorized into the species: <em>Bifidobacterium,
                    Staphylococcus</em>, <em>Acinetobacter</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>,
                <em>Lactococcus</em>, <em>Enterococcus</em> and <em>Lactobacillus.</em> In addition, several yeasts and
                fungi have been identified in breast milk of healthy mothers, including <em>Malassezia, Candida,
                    Saccharomyces</em> and <em>Rhodotorula.</em></p>
            <p>For example, a low amount of gut <em>Bifidobacterium</em> can decrease the amount of energy produced from
                food, which leads to an excessive early weight gain during the first months of life.</p>
            <p><em>Moreover, Lactobacillus gasseri</em> and <em>Lactobacillus fermentum </em>reduces the growth of
                potential pathogenic organisms in the gastrointestinal tract. It does this by producing acetate and
                lactate (can kill several different pathogens) from the sugars ingested by the host.</p>
            <p>The fact that human milk contains bacteria has been known for quite a while, so infant formula has been
                supplemented with several <em>Bifidobacterium</em> strains. This altered the microbiome composition in
                infant but did not affect long-term colonization, which isn‚Äôt too great because long-term health is what
                we‚Äôre striving for.</p>
            <h3>How this bacteria is transfered from the mother to infant</h3>
            <p><strong>Retrograde flow</strong></p>
            <p>Researchers found that <em>Streptococcus</em> spp., which is one of the major bacteria in human milk is
                also widely present in the salivary microbiota. Moreover, <em>Staphylococcus</em> spp.,
                <em>Corynebacterium</em> spp. and <em>Propionibacterium</em> spp., which are common skin bacterias are
                also frequently found in human breast milk.</p>
            <p>This suggests that with a retrograde flow process, some bacteria from the mouth + skin of the infant
                enters back into the mammary ducts.</p>
            <p><strong>Entero-mammary pathway</strong></p>
            <p>The entero-mammary pathway is what connects the mother‚Äôs gut to the mammary glands. Maternal intestinal
                bacteria migrates from the gut by inserting itself into internalization in dendritic cells, which looks
                something like that ‚¨áÔ∏è.</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3756/1*wl-k5MAh_S82GqsAJdtKdw.png" /></p>
            <p>These cells then circulate to the mammary gland via the lymphatic and blood circulation.</p>
            <h3>Neurodevelopment</h3>
            <p>This is a quick summary of how the gut microbiota can influence neurodevelopment, just in case you‚Äôre
                curious:)</p>
            <p>There are several pathways connecting the brain and microbiota:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The vagus nerve</li>
            </ol>
            <p><img alt="The long yellow tube is the vagus nerve"
                    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5000/1*74X17-IyrLwCdbOW6uDNZQ.jpeg" /><em>The long yellow
                    tube is the vagus nerve</em></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The immune system</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Neurotransmitters and metabolites with neuroactive properties produced by the microbiota in the
                        intestines. Your gut has approximately the same number of neurons as the brain of a catüêà.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Moreover, breast milk-derived stem cells also have the capability to differentiate into neural cell
                lineages: neurons expressing √ü-tubulin as a neuron marker, oligodendrocytes expressing the O4 marker,
                and astrocytes expressing the GFAP marker.</p>
            <p>However, even given all of these benefits, of the estimated 140 million women who give birth every year,
                only about 40% of them breastfeed.</p>
            <p>There are many different reasons for this, here‚Äôs a quick summary:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Breastfeeding takes about 10 hours a day</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A lot of people in society associate the breast as a purely sexual organ</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>50% of men surveyed in the united states said that it should be illegal to breastfeed in public.
                        Some women therefore, feel judged and uncomfortable to breastfeed in public</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Breastfeeding can be extremely painful</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Women don‚Äôt always have the financial and emotional support required to breastfeed</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Women are not always in the right sanitary conditions to breastfeed</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Infant formula was created to help work around these issues, and although it is constantly improving,
                formula does not have bacteria, oligosaccharides, and antibodies and cells, all of which were talked
                about above.</p>
            <p>That‚Äôs where synthetic biology comes in, which means that we can:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Culture lactocytes to produce<em> </em>breastmilk <em>in vitro</em></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use <a
                            href="https://elizabethtrykin.medium.com/unlike-what-your-highschool-bio-teacher-says-biology-can-still-happen-without-the-living-c2eb6ace61f5"><em>in
                                vitro p</em>rotein synthesis </a>to grow proteins + antibodies</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use<em> in vitro stem </em>cell growth</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use bacterial strains</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>And create a fluid extremely similar to breastmilk. I will be writing about all of these topics in the
                near future:)</p>
            <p>I‚Äôm also extremely excited to see a future where all infants are given the necessary immunological factor
                to live a healthy life!</p>
            <p>Disclaimer: I in know way am suggesting the replacement of breastfeeding, and would only love for that to
                be something that all women + children get to experience. However, that is extremely difficult to
                accomplish, due to our current societal situation, so I propose the next best solution.</p>
