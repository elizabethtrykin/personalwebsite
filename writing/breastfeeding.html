      <h2>Breastfeeding is the single best way to prevent child-mortality.</h2> If 95% of children were to be breastfed,
      we
      could prevent 823,000 child deaths (half of total annual child deaths)
      and 20,000 breast cancer deaths annually. No other single solution has
      the power to reduce child mortality to such a significant extent.</p>
      <p>Despite this, currently only about 30% of women exclusively
        breastfeed for the first 12 months of their child’s life. There were
        also more women breastfeeding in the 1960s than there are in 2021. That
        means that if the same number of children were breastfed as there were
        in the 60s, we could save about 200,000 children every year.</p>
      <p><strong>Why has the number of women breastfeeding decreased?</strong></p>
        <p>
        Up until the recent 10,000 years, there were two primary methods for
        feeding babies. Mothers either breastfed or they had a wet-nurse that
        would breastfeed their baby. It was thought that all breastmilk was the
        same, and since breastfeeding was low-class, wealthy families option for
        the second option.</p>
      <p>Then, the agricultural revolution happened, and humans domesticated
        animals, so we started to use animal milk as an alternative to
        breastmilk for infants. However, animal milk does not have the right
        composition, with too much sodium and casein. Child mortality rates
        almost doubled, we learned, and now fewer children are fed with pure
        animal milk.</p>
      <p>Then, in the 1970s, infant formula was marketed in a way that
        convinced people it had the same qualities, or in some cases, even
        better nutrients than breastmilk.</p>
      <p>People started realizing this, so now more and more women are
        beginning to breastfeed, compared to the 1970s and 1980s. But we still
        haven’t reached the breastfeeding percentage that stood before the
        formula was introduced. Which is understandable, again, there are many
        many reasons women do not breastfeed.</p>
      <h2 id="how-lactation-works">How Lactation works</h2>
      <p><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p>
      <p> Although the breast experiences
        significant change prior to pregnancy, when women undergo a pregnancy
        and lactation cycle (PLC), the breast is completely remodeled. This
        process is controlled by increased levels of the lactogenic complex of
        reproductive hormones: estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, as well as
        metabolic hormones (growth hormone, glucocorticoids, parathyroid
        hormone-related protein, and insulin).</p>
      <p><strong>Mammary Glands</strong></p>
        <img src="content/glands.jpg">
        <p>Mammary glands (medical term for the
        breast) are modified sweat glands (sweat glands are a type of organ).
        They primarily consist of lactiferous ducts (help transfer milk), which
        expand and branch out during pregnancy. Clusters of breast alveoli form
        from these ducts and expand toward the chest wall (ribs), since that is
        the contact point with the rest of the body.</p>
      <p>Alveoli look like small balloons, lined with lactocytes, which are
        the cells that produce most of the breastmilk. Milk is secreted by the
        lactocytes, filled into the alveoli, then squeezed through the ducts
        into the milk ducts and into the nipple.</p>
      <p>The breast undergoes 2 phases throughout the preparation for
        breastfeeding.</p>
      <p><strong>Secretory differentiation</strong> </p>
      <p>In this stage, the
        hormones in a woman’s body induce the stem cells in the breast to <a
          href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/regulation-of-gene-expression-and-cell-specialization/v/cellular-specialization-differentiation">differentiate</a>
        into lactocytes, which then have the capacity to synthesize (generate)
        breast milk.</p>
      <p>Up until delivery, a hormone called progesterone interferes with the
        prolactin hormone, which prevents the mammary glands from fully
        lactating. So in order for the mother to have the ability to breastfeed,
        a second step of hormonal processes needs to occur.</p>
      <p>However, during this stage, the glands still have the capacity to
        produce small amounts of a pre-milk substance called colostrum. This
        substance lasts about 6 weeks after the child’s birth and is the most
        concentrated in antibodies and nutrients. When a child is born, they are
        exposed to so many new pathogens (although there are currently studies
        being done that suggest the fetus is exposed to bacteria in the
        placenta). Colostrum is the first substance that is fed to the child,
        which is why it is the most concentrated in immunogenic components.</p>
      <p><strong>Secretory Activation</strong><p>

      </p> When the child is born,
        progesterone hormone levels significantly decrease, which signals the
        mammary glands to start producing real breastmilk.</p>
      <h2 id="components-of-breastmilk">Components of breastmilk</h2>
      <p>Human milk contains over 2,500 different components, the
        concentration of which can change every hour. This makes human milk one
        of the most complex fluids on earth.</p>
      <p>Previous research shows that the primary component is water (87%),
        and most of the other components are categorized into either lactose
        (7%), fats (4%), and proteins (1.0%). However, we are now understanding
        that breastmilk also contains complete cells, although it is
        underdetermined at what amounts.</p>
      <p>All of the molecular components of breast milk are either synthesized
        by lactocytes (the breastmilk-producing cells I previously talked about
        in the breast) or imported into milk from the breast’s blood supply.
        However, breastfeeding is extremely understudied, which means that very
        little research has been done on how some of the nutrients actually get
        to the breastmilk.</p>
      <p>I will mostly be writing about the immunogenic components of
        breastmilk since the absence of those is the biggest factor in child
        mortality. It is important to consider that although it is not the focus
        of this article, casein, fats, minerals, and vitamins are extremely
        important for the development of the child (especially the prefrontal
        cortex).</p>
      <p><strong>Immunogenic components</strong></p>
      <p> The transplacental (between
        mother and child) transfer of immunogenic functions is extremely
        important for a newborn. There are three primary ways immunity is
        transferred:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Transfer of antibodies through the placenta</li>
        <li>Anti-infective resistance factors in the amniotic fluid (a fluid
          excreted by the infant that fills up the amniotic sac which coats the
          child in the womb).</li>
        <li>Through colostrum and milk (what I’m narrowing into in the rest of
          this article)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The primary chemical barrier that protects the intestine is contained
        in the mucus layers lining the gastrointestinal tract. These mucus
        layers minimize contact between pathogens that enter the bacteria and
        the epithelial cells inside the stomach.</p>
      <p>There are multiple different types of immunogenic factors in
        breastmilk including: immunoglobulins (antibodies), lactoferrin,
        lysozymes, and cytokines. New research also shows that breast milk
        contains epithelial cells, stem cells, and is a continuous source of
        beneficial (probiotic) bacteria, including Lactobacillus and
        Bifidobacterium.</p>
      <p>All of these factors add another layer of complex protection to the
        intestinal mucus layers.</p>
      <p><strong>Immunoglobulins (antibodies)</strong><p>

      </p> Immunoglobulins are the
        primary proteins protecting a human from infection. The primary
        immunoglobulin in breastmilk is Secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), which
        makes up about 90% of all antibodies in breastmilk. SIgA lines the
        inside of the stomach and blocks pathogen contact with the intestinal
        epithelial layer by binding to and trapping them. SIgA ends up sitting
        in the stomach throughout the life of a human, protected from
        proteolysis by sugar components (galactose, fucose, and mannose) caused
        by the acids (the breakdown of proteins).</p>
      <p>Immunoglobulins are transferred to the mammary glands through the
        <strong>entero-mammary link.</strong> This is a blood pathway linking
        the mother’s gut and the alveoli of the breast. This is extremely
        understudied, however, researchers hypothesize that when the woman’s
        hormone levels change, this signals different components to be sent to
        the breast. How and why these hormones change is what we have yet to
        understand.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Cells in breastmilk</strong>      </p>

      <p> Researchers first discovered the
        presence of cells in breastmilk about a decade ago when they found
        modified milk stem cells within the brain, thymus, pancreas, liver,
        spleen, and kidneys of an infant. Every month, new research is coming
        out about the cells contained in breast milk. Here is a diagram of the
        most up-to-date knowledge of these cells:</p>
        <img src= "content/cells.png">
      <p>The cells originating in the breast include lactocytes (secretory
        cells), myoepithelial cells, progenitor cells, and mammary stem cells,
        and a small number of epithelial cells from the nipple and skin of the
        breast. Cells originating from the blood include immune cells
        (macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) and hematopoietic stem
        cells.</p>
      <p><strong>Leukocytes — white blood cells</strong> Animal studies have
        proved that white blood cells found in breast milk survive through the
        infant’s digestive tract, and then translocate into the blood, lymph
        nodes, spleen, and liver. In the diagram, everything under
        “immunological cells” is a type of white blood cell.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWSWWPZYGHU">White blood
          cells</a> are extremely essential to our bodies, by fighting pathogens
        directly via phagocytosis (killing pathogens), producing bioactive
        components (such as antibodies) modifying the microenvironment of the
        infant digestive tract. However, they only constitute &lt; 2% of cells
        that travel to the breast through the bloodstream. So, that leaves the
        question about what all the other cells are.</p>
      <p><strong>Stem cells</strong> </p><p>A few studies suggested that human milk
        contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are found in bone marrow
        and are important for making and repairing skeletal tissues, such as
        cartilage, bone, and the fat found in bone marrow. Researchers have also
        discovered that breast milk contains pluripotent stem cells, which have
        the ability to replicate into more stem cells, as well as differentiate
        into any cell in the body. For example, we have been able to
        differentiate pluripotent cells in vitro into adipose cells,
        chondrocytes, osteoblasts, neuronal cells, hepatocyte-like cells, and
        pancreatic beta cells, as well as lactocytes and myoepithelial cells.
        That’s a lot of words for these stem cells can literally turn into any
        cell in the body, and breastmilk provides a supply of them to the
        infant.</p>
      <p><strong>Macrophages</strong></p>
      <p> About 80% of the cells in early milk are
        breast milk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNrD8uPPf4w&amp;t=3s">macrophages</a>,
        originating as peripheral blood monocytes, which look something like
        the image below.</p>
        <img src="content/macrophages.jpeg">
      <p>These cells are constantly circulating in the bloodstream, and with
        the right hormone levels, will exit the bloodstream and migrate into
        milk through the mammary epithelium (cells that line the surface of the
        milk ducts in the breast). The presence of GM-CSF, which is a cytokine
        (signaling protein) causes these monocytes to differentiate into potent
        breast milk macrophages. The macrophages then have the ability to
        differentiate into dendritic cells that stimulate infant T-cell
        (immunological) activity.</p>
      <p><strong>Oligosaccharides</strong></p><p>Glycoproteins are proteins that
        have oligosaccharide attached to them.</p>
        <img src= "content/oligosaccharides.png">
      <p>This is a protein, and the different shapes are different
        oligosaccharide attached to it.</p>
      <p>Human milk glycoproteins (HMGPs) MUC1 and MUC4 bind to HIV,
        rotavirus, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Salmonella</em> pathogens.
        There are other HMGPs that bind to <em>H. influenzae</em>, Streptococci,
        <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, Reovirus, <em>E. coli</em>, and
        <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>. The interactions between glycoprotein and
        ligands are being modeled using nanosurface plasmon resonance and glycan
        microarrays.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Lactoferrin</strong></p>
      <p> SIgA (the antibody I previously talked
        about) and lactoferrin correspond to 26% of the protein content of
        breast milk. So, these two components are extremely important, and
        therefore, are the ones I am studying.</p>
      <p>What lactoferrin does is it regulates how well the iron is absorbed
        by the immune system. In particular, lactoferrin binds the iron in
        breast milk, which limits its availability to pathogens. In this way, it
        also starves the bacteria of nutrients, and just in case that wasn’t
        enough, will sometimes destroy the walls around bacteria.</p>
      <p>Lactoferrin has many other abilities, for example it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Has a direct cytotoxic effect against bacteria, viruses, and
          fungi</li>
        <li>Blocks inflammatory cytokines (signal-sending proteins) such as
          IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-824–26.</li>
        <li>Interferes with viral attachment as well as the contact with the
          specific entry receptors, such as ACE2. <strong>Angiotensin-converting
            enzyme 2</strong> (<strong>ACE2</strong>) is an enzyme that attaches to
          the membranes of cells located in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney,
          and intestines. This creates an interference and can sometimes result in
          lowered blood pressure. Therefore, targeting ACE2 is a cool option for
          treating and preventing cardiovascular diseases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are several other glycoproteins, another one being Lactadherin,
        which can inactivate viruses and limit inflammation by increasing the
        effective phagocytosis (killing) of apoptotic (useless but not yet dead)
        cells. The list of bioactive glycoproteins in human milk is constantly
        expanding and their individual functions are being studied.</p>
      <p><strong>The gut microbiome</strong></p>
      <p> The gut microbiome is
        consistently being linked to literally every disease you could possibly
        imagine. Having a greater diversity of bacteria in the gut is directly
        linked to better mental and physical health.</p>
      <p>For example, chronic cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of
        mortality in the US, with heart disease and diabetes costing &gt;$500
        billion a year, and affecting around 60% of individuals over their
        lifetime. Pathogenesis (development of a disease) develops over decades,
        with many different contributing factors, such as environmental
        exposures, diet, and genetic background.</p>
      <p>However, researchers have found that people with a more diverse
        microbiome are less likely to develop a cardiovascular disease. The
        diversity of the gut microbiota is primarily expanded in the first years
        of our lives, and dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) in infancy may affect
        the long-term health of the gut microbiota.</p>
      <p>Breastmilk is the main contributor to a well-developed and diverse
        microbiome, due to an active presence of bacteria. It is estimated that
        an infant feeding on 800 ml of breast milk per day could ingest 107–108
        bacterial cells daily!</p>
      <p>To date, metagenomic analysis of human milk shows that it contains
        &gt;360 different prokaryotic cells. The most frequent bacteria found in
        human milk are categorized into the species: <em>Bifidobacterium,
          Staphylococcus</em>, <em>Acinetobacter</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em>,
        <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Lactococcus</em>, <em>Enterococcus</em> and
        <em>Lactobacillus</em>. In addition, several yeasts and fungi have been
        identified in breast milk of healthy mothers, including <em>Malassezia,
          Candida, Saccharomyces</em> and <em>Rhodotorula</em>.
      </p>
      <p>For example, a low amount of gut <em>Bifidobacterium</em> can
        decrease the amount of energy produced from food, which leads to
        excessive early weight gain during the first months of life. Moreover,
        <em>Lactobacillus gasseri</em> and <em>Lactobacillus fermentum</em>
        reduce the growth of potential pathogenic organisms in the
        gastrointestinal tract. It does this by producing acetate and lactate
        (can kill several different pathogens) from the sugars ingested by the
        host.
      </p>
      <p>The fact that human milk contains bacteria has been known for quite a
        while, so infant formula has been supplemented with several
        <em>Bifidobacterium</em> strains. This altered the microbiome
        composition in infants but did not affect long-term colonization, which
        isn’t too great because long-term health is what we’re striving for.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Retrograde flow</strong> </p>
      <p>Researchers found that
        <em>Streptococcus</em> spp., which is one of the major bacteria in human
        milk is also widely present in the salivary microbiota. Moreover,
        <em>Staphylococcus</em> spp., <em>Corynebacterium</em> spp. and
        <em>Propionibacterium</em> spp., which are common skin bacteria are also
        frequently found in human breast milk. This suggests that with a
        retrograde flow process, some bacteria from the mouth and skin of the
        infant enter back into the mammary ducts.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Entero-mammary pathway</strong> </p>
      <p>The entero-mammary pathway is
        what connects the mother’s gut to the mammary glands. Maternal
        intestinal bacteria migrate from the gut by inserting itself into
        internalization in dendritic cells, which looks something like this:</p>
        <img src= "content/bacteria.png">
      <p>These cells then circulate to the mammary gland via the lymphatic and
        blood circulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Neurodevelopment</strong></p>
      <p> This is a quick summary of how the
        gut microbiota can influence neurodevelopment, just in case you’re
        curious:</p>
      <p>There are several pathways connecting the brain and microbiota:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>The vagus nerve</li>
      </ol>
      <img src= "content/vagus.jpeg" height="200px" width="200px">
      <p><em>The long yellow tube is the vagus nerve</em></p>
      <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis</li>
        <li>The immune system</li>
        <li>Neurotransmitters and metabolites with neuroactive properties
          produced by the microbiota in the intestines. Your gut has approximately
          the same number of neurons as the brain of a cat.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Moreover, breast milk-derived stem cells also have the capability to
        differentiate into neural cell lineages: neurons expressing ß-tubulin as
        a neuron marker, oligodendrocytes expressing the O4 marker, and
        astrocytes expressing the GFAP marker.</p>
      <p>However, even given all of these benefits, of the estimated 140
        million women who give birth every year, only about 40% of them
        breastfeed.</p>
      <p>There are many different reasons for this:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Breastfeeding takes about 10 hours a day</li>
        <li>A lot of people in society associate the breast as a purely sexual
          organ</li>
        <li>50% of men surveyed in the United States said that it should be
          illegal to breastfeed in public. Some women, therefore, feel judged and
          uncomfortable to breastfeed in public</li>
        <li>Breastfeeding can be extremely painful</li>
        <li>Women don’t always have the financial and emotional support required
          to breastfeed</li>
        <li>Women are not always in the right sanitary conditions to
          breastfeed</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Infant formula was created to help work around these issues, and
        although it is constantly improving, formula does not have bacteria,
        oligosaccharides, antibodies, and cells needed for a child's development.</p>
