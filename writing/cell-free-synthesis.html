            <h1>Unlike what your highschool bio teacher says — Biology can still happen without the living…</h1>
            <p><strong>A guide to producing proteins Cell-Free Protein production of Immunglobulin A for insertion into infant
                formula</strong></p>
            <p>I’ve been researching breastmilk for a few months now, for the purpose of figuring out a way we can
                produce this
                extremely complex fluid outside of the human body, or at least synthesize some of it’s components.</p>
            <p>Breastmilk contains around 2,500 different components. This is mostly water (87%), carbs, primarily
                lactose (7%),
                fats (4%), and proteins (1%). There are many different types of proteins, but antibodies are arguable
                the most
                important for the immune system.</p>
            <p>Secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) makes up about 90% of all antibodies in breastmilk. It acts as a
                barrier between
                the stomach lining. and bacteria that enters the body.</p>
            <p>I started out by proposing the synthesis (production) of sIgA by using <a
                    href="https://elizabethtrykin.medium.com/using-tobacco-plants-to-grow-antibodies-for-better-breastmilk-replication-f986f9096a0?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">agrobacterium-mediated
                    gene transfer to grow them in transgenic tobacco plants. </a>That’s big words for giving tobacco
                plants
                instructions to produce the protein I want them to produce (in this case it was an antibody).</p>
            <p>Although I proposed to use plants in this case because it was cheaper + more scalable, the production
                cost is still
                extremely high. It would be nearly impossible to lower the cost by 10x using that same process. As <a
                    href="https://www.ted.com/talks/astro_teller_the_unexpected_benefit_of_celebrating_failure#t-635908">Astro
                    Teller</a> says, you can’t significantly decrease the process of something by 10% decrements.</p>
            <p>So, I did a root cause analysis as to why this process was so expensive. About A major part of the
                process cost was
                protein purification (how the proteins are removed from the plant once they have been synthesized).</p>
            <p>The cells need to kept alive and here is an image of the machinery that goes into that:</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2552/1*OFMe29rlg6-I8YbL8fYmZA.png" /></p>
            <p>Although I worked around parts of this by using plants, growing plants is still quite expensive. The
                plants need to
                be kept at a constant temperature, given nutrients, maintained etc.</p>
            <p>The cells also produce more than just the protein that I need, so they end up waisting a lot of the
                resources just
                for regular processes.</p>
            <p>So then, I thought about how there’s only 4 primary components of the cell that are actually required in
                protein
                production. Why not isolate them, and synthesize proteins like that?</p>
            <p>Turns out, there have been others who have thought of doing the same. This thought has been around for
                about 50
                years, however, we only now are beginning to leverage it for protein synthesis. It’s not very
                widespread, but is
                very successful when used. By using this process, I can produce proteins at 10x less the cost and at
                about 28x the
                speed.</p>
            <p>Now, just in case you’re curious, the rest if this article is the science behind how this can be done.
            </p>
            <h2>The central dogma of biology — Protein Synthesis</h2>
            <p>Here’s a quick simple bio lesson:</p>
            <h3>Transcription (in the nucleus of the cell)</h3>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4216/1*dDAuzuMLBw3dYPTpIPUxLg.png" /></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>RNA polymerase unzips the DNA that contains the gene for the protein to me made</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Complimentary RNA nucleotides attach to one strand of the DNA. (Adenine bonds with thymine, and
                        cytosine
                        bonds with guanine)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The strand that is left is called mRNA</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Translation (outside the nucleus of the cell)</h3>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2574/1*kSfUNuzkAD-oR7j-4gLq9A.png" /></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The mRNA strand travels outside the nucleus into the cytoplasm</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids attach to the mRNA molecules in a <a
                            href="https://www.lcps.org/cms/lib/VA01000195/Centricity/Domain/4726/Table%20of%20DNA%20Base%20Triplet.pdf">specific
                            order</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The output are amino acids, which are ordered in a specific way and can now fold into a protein.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>The old way of in vitro protein production</h2>
            <p>(this isn’t the new technology yet, just some context, so skip this too if you are just interested in the
                new way</p>
            <p>Proteins are made of amino acids that fold in a certain way, and the instructions for the folding is
                encoded within
                DNA.</p>
            <p>So, in order to make a cell produce a certain protein, we have to insert the DNA into that cell. There
                are a couple
                different ways that this is done, but the primary method is by using a plasmid, which are circular
                pieces of DNA
                carriers in bacteria. Bacteria is really really good at transferring DNA to other organisms, and
                plasmids are what
                is responsible for that.</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*nNWwHwZtaJAz-_vyb6iKUA.png" /></p>
            <p>Researchers came up with a way to leverage plasmids for DNA transfer. Genes of choice can be inserted
                into a plasmid,
                and that new structure (called a vector, since its now synthetic) is used to transfer DNA to a new
                organism</p>
            <p>The vectors are then introduced to the cell, perform the gene transfer, and the cell begins to produce
                the protein
                encoded by the new DNA. Once the proteins reach a certain level of growth, the cells are lysed (a
                science word for
                tearing apart using a cool blender) and then purified, since there are more than just proteins in this
                substance.
            </p>
            <p>But, there are several disadvantages to this process, including slow protein growth, expensive
                purification, toxic
                proteins, poor yields, high monitoring etc.</p>
            <h2>Cel-Free Protein Synthesis (SFPS)</h2>
            <p>(This is what everything’s been leading up to)</p>
            <p>Cell lysates provide the correct composition and proportion of enzymes and building blocks required for
                translation.
                (Usually, an energy source and amino acids must also be added to sustain synthesis.) Cell membranes are
                removed to
                leave only the cytosolic and organelle components of the cell (hence the term, “cell-free extracts”).
                The first
                types of lysates developed for cell-free protein expression were derived from prokaryotic organisms.
                More recently,
                systems based on extracts from insect cells, mammalian cells and human cells have been developed and
                made
                commercially available.</p>
            <h3>Cell-free protein synthesis</h3>
            <p>Because there are really only a few components of the cell that operate to synthesize proteins, the
                entire cell isn’t
                required for this process.</p>
            <p>There are two components required for in vitro protein expression:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The genetic material (mRNA or DNA) encoding the target protein (in this case its an antibody)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A solution that contains the molecules that will do the transcription and translation (from
                        genetic material
                        to protein). These include:</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>RNA polymerases for mRNA transcription (the very first step)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>ribosomes for polypeptide translation</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>tRNA and amino acids</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>enzymatic cofactors and an energy source for the process</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>in some cases other cellular components essential for proper protein folding</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How these components are gathered:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Live cells are grown in liquid culture (just normal cell growth)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The cells are harvested out of the culture</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The cells are busted open— usually done by vibrating the cells until they explode. Then gather
                        the cellular
                        components that are required for protein synthesis (as explained above).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once the DNA is introduced to into the lysed cell, the process begins. About 2 hours later, the proteins
                can be
                extracted and purified.</p>
            <p>There are several different types of cells that can be used for cell-free protein synthesis, each have
                advantages +
                disadvantages.</p>
            <p>Secretory Immunoglobulin A is a higher order protein complex that is formed by several different parts
                that come
                together. One of the processes involved in this is called glycosylation, a process by which a sugar is
                attached to a
                part of the protein to help it properly fold.</p>
            <p>There are only certain cells that are able to perform glycosylation — most of which are Eukorotic cells.
            </p>
            <p>There is also the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is only present in Eukaryotic (animal) cells. The ER
                is
                responsible for part of the protein folding process — it creates an oxidative (lacking oxygen)
                environment, which
                helps form + stabilize disulphide bonds in the antibody.</p>
            <p><img alt="The red lines show disulfide bonds."
                    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2392/1*OZhO3bNYJSVgUtseemV_Hg.png" /><em>The red lines show
                    disulfide
                    bonds.</em></p>
            <p>Another protein, called BiP helps make sure that the heavy chain (at the bottom of the antibody) doesn’t
                unfold.
                Prolyl isomerases have also been proven to be involved in catalyzing the protein folding step.</p>
            <p>Long story short, there are certain cellular components in mammalian cells to aid in the complex process
                of protein
                folding, so that it is done correctly with minimal errors. However, bacteria are extremely easy to use,
                fast to
                grow, need low maintenance and are easily manipulated.</p>
            <p>That means that the next problem to be solved, is figuring out a way to generate a bacterial system that
                is optimized
                for the folding of eukaryotic proteins.</p>
            <h3>Open-cell Free Synthesis</h3>
            <p>So, smart people found a way to work around this problem as well, creating an open-cell free synthesis
                system, which
                allows us to add certain components to <em>E. coli </em>strains for improved protein folding.</p>
            <p>This process has been done for Immunoglobulin G, where each of the following chaperones (components that
                can aid in
                protein folding) were tested to determine which improves expression the best.</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2452/1*FbEPJThfJvsLF5srzffT3A.png" /></p>
            <p>Before expression IgA in a bacterial cell, a similar approach will take place to determine which
                chaperones should be
                over-expressed. Since high concentrations of purified chaperone proteins is extremely expensive and
                labor-intensive,
                we can instead can create bacterial strains that over-express the specific protein.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned previously, bacteria contain plasmids, which are circular pieces of DNA. One the
                chaperones are
                determined, we can insert the over-expression gene into the plasmid of a bacteria, which will ensure
                that there are
                greater quantities of the specified proteins in the growing cell.</p>
            <p>Even though the mammalian Endoplasmic Reticulum is a powerful system that can ensure proper protein
                folding, to
                increase efficiency, we can add substitutes to the cells. According to the research done on
                Immunoglobulin G, adding
                3 of the top chaperones can improve protein folding by 40%.</p>
            <p><img alt="A diagram of a comparison between regular protein synthesis, vs cell-free protein synthesis"
                    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2460/1*xBz1xCjdnEHfrUL5IM9iQQ.png" /><em>A diagram of a
                    comparison
                    between regular protein synthesis, vs cell-free protein synthesis</em></p>
            <p>The proteins can then be purified from the rest of the components. However, the there are only 5–7
                cellular
                components that are filtered out, which decreases the number of times and ways the protein is to be
                purified.</p>
            <p>And on that note, that’s the end of my thought process around cell-free protein synthesis. If you have
                any questions
                or thoughts, feel free to reach out, I’m more than happy to have a conversation!</p>
