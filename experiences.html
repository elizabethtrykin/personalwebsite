    <p><strong>Intern at Morneau Shepell's Children Support Solutions</strong></p>
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
      <p>Working with autistic children, my role was split helping therapists + speech pathologists
        and building a web-app for non-verbal toddlers that use pictures and images to communicate. 
        The algorithm for the latter was similar to text suggestion, but presented images instead.

    <p><strong>Founded a tutoring saas business</strong></p>
    <blockquote class="wscaledp-block-quote">
      <p>Tutoring one student at a time (math, science, Essay writing, prep for special high-school programs etc.)
        became extremely tedious and time-consuming, so I eventually built a software with a subscription model for
        the students. I went from 20 hours/week with 10 students to only 10 hours/week, with about 35 students at its peak. </p>
