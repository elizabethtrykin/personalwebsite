    <p><strong>Intern at Morneau Shepell's Children Support Solutions</strong></p>
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
      <p>I worked with behaviour + occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists, 
        helping autistic children. I learned to communicate with children that struggled 
        to interact with the outside world. Folowing the internship, I built a web-app for 
        non-verbal toddlers that use pictures and images to communicate. 
        The algorithm was exactly like a text suggestion, but used images instead.

    <p><strong>Consulting, The Dariu Foundation</strong></p>
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
      <p>  My team and I built and implemented a recommendation for the The Dariu Foundation for "The Impossible Project", 
        aiming to teach digital skills to 7 million children in Southeast Asia.</p>

    <p><strong>Private tutor, turning it into a saas business</strong></p>
    <blockquote class="wscaledp-block-quote">
      <p>Tutoring one student at a time (math, science, Essay writing, prep for special high-school programs etc.)
        became extremely tedious and time-consuming, so I eventually built a software with a subscription model for
        the students. I  from 20 hours/week with 10 students to only 10 hours/week, with about 35 students at its peak. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:30px">Brainstormed the idea of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.labdao.xyz/" target="_blank">LabDAO</a>
        with the founder before it became an established DAO. The goal of the project is to create an open community of CROs
        (Contract Research Organizations) to outsource wet &amp; dry lab experiments. I have been contributing to the
        open-community project since. </p>
